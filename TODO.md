## File Conversion Progress

### By Directory (Using .converted.asm tracking):
- **audio/**: 11/12 files converted (91%)
- **battle/actions**: 15/182 files converted (8%)
- **system/math/**: 9/29 files converted (31%)
- **text/**: 7/85 files converted (8%)
- **misc/**: 6/58 files converted (10%) - Equipment & wallet
- **system/**: 5/63 files converted (7%) - Core utilities  
- **overworld/**: 3/96 files converted (3%) - Basic functions
- **inventory/**: 2/4 files converted (50%)

### Total Progress: 58/3,708 ASM files converted (1.6%)

**Progress Tracking System**: All converted ASM files are renamed to `.converted.asm`
- Check progress: `./check_progress.sh`
- Find unconverted files: `find src -name "*.asm" | grep -v ".converted"`

## Phases
- **Phase 1** - Core Systems
- **Phase 2** - Game Logic
- **Phase 3** - Content & Polish
- **Phase 4** - Testing & Optimization

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Text/Dialogue System** - Convert text rendering and dialogue functions
2. **More Battle Actions** - Convert remaining battle action functions
3. **Overworld Movement** - Implement complex movement and collision functions  
4. **PSI/Magic System** - Convert spell and magic functions
5. **Menu Systems** - Convert UI and menu handling functions
6. **Save/Load System** - Implement game state persistence

## Recent Achievements
- **Total Progress: 58/3,708 files (1.6%)**
- **Audio system 91% complete (11/12 files)**
- **System math 31% complete (9/29 files)**
- **Inventory 50% complete (2/4 files)**
- **Battle actions 8% complete (15/182 files)**
- **Working compilation system** with zero warnings
- **984+ lines of clean C code** across 8 game systems

## Notes
- Keep C code simple and human-readable
- Avoid verbose ASM references in comments
- Unknown function names stay as "unknown" unless obvious
- Focus on compilation without ASM dependencies
- Maintain original functionality and behavior
