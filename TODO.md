- **inventory/**: 2/4 files converted (50%)

### Total Progress: 102/3,455 executable ASM files converted (3.0%)

**Progress Tracking System**: All converted ASM files are renamed to `.converted.asm`
- Check progress: `./check_progress.sh`
- Find unconverted files: `find src -name "*.asm" | grep -v ".converted"`

## Notes
- Keep C code simple and human-readable
- Avoid verbose ASM references in comments
- Unknown function names stay as "unknown" unless obvious
- Focus on compilation without ASM dependencies
- Maintain original functionality and behavior
