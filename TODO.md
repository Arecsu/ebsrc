# EarthBound Decompilation TODO

## Project Overview
Converting 3,455 executable assembly files to maintainable C code with functional equivalence to the original game. Focus on cross-platform compatibility and modern development practices.

## Architecture Change: Functional Equivalence Strategy ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Abandon bit-identical ROM reproduction in favor of:
- **Functional equivalence** - same behavior, modern C practices
- **Flexible memory layout** - allow compiler optimization
- **Cross-platform foundation** - support SDL ports to Linux/Windows/Mac
- **ROM data integrity** - preserve assets via .incbin inclusion

## Current Status  
- **8 C modules created** with 1500+ lines of code
- **143+ functions converted** from ASM to C (143/3455 files = 4.1% complete)
- **Complete C compilation system working** with ROM data access layer
- **Zero warnings with strict GCC flags**
- **Updated architecture documentation** for hybrid build approach
- Organized header structure with proper includes
- Clean build system with separate object directory

## Immediate Priority - Phase 1 Architecture Implementation üö®

**All current work is Phase 1 development** - see ARCHITECTURE.md for full multi-phase strategy

### Build System Modernization (Phase 1) ‚úÖ
- [x] **Pure C build system implemented** - Makefile.phase1 with CC65-only compilation
- [x] **C bank generator created** - tools/generate_c_banks.py for ASM‚ÜíC transition  
- [x] **Memory layout designed** - snes_phase1.cfg with flexible C segments
- [x] **Copyright-safe ROM handling** - extraction-based approach, no ROM data in repo
- [x] **System vectors preserved** - critical SNES boot code stays as ASM
- [ ] **Test Pure C build system** - validate ROM generation and functionality

### Phase 1 Validation and Testing
- [ ] **Test Pure C build system** - validate with donor ROM extraction
- [ ] **Compare functional equivalence** - verify behavior matches ASM build  
- [ ] **Cross-validate ROM generation** - test different ROM variants (US/JP/Proto)

### Critical System Files (.critical.asm) ‚úÖ
- [x] **System vectors renamed** - .critical.asm extension marks permanently ASM-only
- [x] **Hardware boot requirements preserved** - RESET/NMI/IRQ vectors stay fixed
- [x] **Memory layout finalized** - snes_phase1.cfg handles flexible C + fixed vectors
