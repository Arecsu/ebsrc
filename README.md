This is currently a disassembly of the game known as Earthbound in the west and Mother 2 in the east.

Currently, I'm converting ASM to C code using LLMs whenever I can.

Reference the [original repo](https://github.com/Herringway/ebsrc) in order to get a working build out of ASM files 

In this repo, ASM build is broken due to renaming files to ".converted.asm" which have been ported to C.

## TODO

**The main task is converting ASM to C. This is being tracked in the file TODO.md**
